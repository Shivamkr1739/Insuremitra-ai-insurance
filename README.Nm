AI-First B2C Insurance Product Idea - 'InsureMitra Plus'
1. Problem Understanding
India's insurance penetration remains low due to lack of awareness, complexity in policy selection, trust
issues, and limited digital literacy among a large section of the population. GroMo's partners face challenges
in scaling distribution to Tier 2, 3, and rural consumers who require personalized, easy-to-understand
insurance recommendations.
2. Proposed Solution - InsureMitra Plus
'InsureMitra Plus' is an AI-powered, multilingual mobile-first insurance advisor that combines conversational
AI, risk profiling, and dynamic policy recommendation to help Indian households choose the best-fit insurance
plans with zero manual intervention.

- Risk Profiling using age, health data, location, dependents, and income
- Instant Policy Matching with insurer APIs and curated recommendations
- Smart Claim Assistant to guide users during policy usage
- Offline Mode with auto-sync for low-connectivity regions
3. Business Impact
- Increases partner earnings by boosting conversion through AI-driven personalization
- Improves user retention by simplifying post-sale engagement (claim, renewal, FAQ)
- Enhances trust and accessibility, especially in non-English speaking regions
- Allows partners to handle more clients with less effort using AI assistance
4. AI Integration
- NLP models for multilingual understanding and intent classification
- Machine learning for dynamic risk scoring and plan recommendation
